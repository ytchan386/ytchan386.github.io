				<p>JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a widely used image format that is known for its ability to compress digital images without significantly degrading their quality. JPEG files are commonly used for photographs, digital artwork, and other types of images that require high levels of detail and colour accuracy. The format works by analysing the colour and brightness of adjacent pixels and then grouping them together into blocks, which can be compressed without losing too much detail. JPEG files are compatible with a wide range of devices and software applications and are often used for sharing images online or in digital publications.</p>

				<p><b>What is a JPG/JPEG?</b><br>
				<li>Name: Joint Photographic Experts Group, in short JPG or JPEG</li>
				<li>Invented in <b>1986</b>,  by a group of experts from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).</li>
				<li>Designed to allow for the efficient compression of digital images <b>without significant loss of quality</b>. </li>
				<li>Today, the JPG format is <b>one of the most widely used image formats</b> in the world.</li></p>

				<p><b>How is JPG better than the other image formats?</b>
				<li><b>File size:</b> JPG files can be compressed without losing too much detail, which means that they can be smaller in size compared to other image formats like BMP or TIFF. This makes them easier to store, share, and upload online.</li>
				<li><b>Compatibility:</b> JPG files are compatible with a wide range of devices and software applications, making them a versatile choice for sharing images. Most digital cameras and smartphones use JPG as their default image format.</li>
				<li><b>Quality:</b> JPG files are capable of producing high-quality images with a range of colours and tones, making them a popular choice for photographers and graphic designers.</li>
				<li><b>Editing:</b> JPG files can be edited using a variety of software applications, allowing for adjustments to brightness, contrast, colour, and other image attributes.</li>
				<br>
				<p><b>How is JPG worse than the other image formats? </b>
				<li><b>Lossy Compression:</b> JPG uses lossy compression, which means that some detail is lost during compression. This can result in a loss of image quality, particularly if the compression level is set too high.</li>
				<li><b>Limited Transparency: </b> JPG does not support transparency, meaning that it cannot be used for images with transparent backgrounds. Other image formats like PNG and GIF support transparency.</li>
				<li><b>Limited Editing: </b> JPG is a compressed image format, it can be more difficult to edit compared to other image formats like BMP or TIFF. Repeated editing can result in a loss of image quality.</li>
				<li><b>Limited Colour Depth: </b> JPG supports 24-bit colour depth, which may not be sufficient for images that require a higher level of colour accuracy or detail.</li>
				<li><b>Artefacts: </b> In some cases, JPG compression can result in visual artefacts such as blockiness or blurriness, particularly in areas with high contrast or sharp edges.</li></p>

				<li><b>Using Image Editing Software: </b> Most image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or PaintShop Pro, allow you to create and save images in JPEG format. Simply create or edit an image in the software and then choose "Save As" or "Export" and select JPEG as the file format.</li>
				<li><b>Quality:</b> JPG files are capable of producing high-quality images with a range of colours and tones, making them a popular choice for photographers and graphic designers.</li>
				<li><b>Using Online Converters: </b> There are many online image converters that allow you to convert images to JPEG format. Simply upload your image to the converter and select JPEG as the output format. Some popular online converters include Online-Convert, Zamzar, and Convertio.</li></ol>
